 PVPGN UPDATE INFORMATION
==========================

This file contains a summary of all changes from previous version you need to 
take care of when updating your server to the current version.
It should contain:
-- info's about all new/changed parameters in bnetd.conf
-- all new/changed config files in the conf/ subfolder
The path's specified are those of the default unix installation

 Updating from 1.7.5 to 1.7.6
==============================

Configuration files changed:
- conf/bnetd.conf : moved the old "servername" parameter to "hostname" 
- conf/bnetd.conf : introduced "servername" parameter for server identification

 Updating from 1.7.3 to 1.7.4
==============================
- conf/bnetd.conf : added "ladder_prefix" parameter to allow only games with 
    matching gamename to be counted as ladder (applies only to alternative 
    ladder game types as specified by "ladder_games" directive)

 Updating from 1.7.1 to 1.7.2
==============================

Configuration files changed:
- conf/bnetd.conf : added "sync_on_logoff" parameter to have account data 
    saved to disk on user's logoff
- conf/d2cs.conf : added "bak_charsavedir" & "bak_charinfodir" parameter so
    d2cs can delete the backup copy of charactars deleted by the client.
    these settings need to be set the same as the d2dbs.conf parameters
    of the same name

 Updating from 1.7.0 to 1.7.1
==============================

Configuration files changed:
- conf/bnetd.conf : added "max_connections" parameter to set up the max 
    allowed number of connections to the bnetd daemon
- conf/d2cs.conf : added "max_connections" parameter to set up the max 
    allowed number of connections to the d2cs daemon
- conf/d2dbs.conf : added "difficulty_hack" parameter to activate the
    Diablo II level 100 workaround

 Updating from 1.6.x to 1.7.0
==============================

Because of the many changes in 1.7.0 we recommend to use a clean install 
and update the configuration files as necesarry. Things to note:
1. you now need GNU make to build PvPGN on POSIX systems (on Linux this is 
just "make" but on *BSD is "gmake")
2. d2trans,gametrans,w3trans have been unified under address_translation.conf 
file which has a complete new syntax so take care with that
